And that ends your introduction to Terraform on Azure. The core content that you have just consumed was largely built from the guides we have on the [HashiCorp Learning Portal](https://learn.hashicorp.com). I encourage you to explore some of the other product guides that have been made available, in particular the [HashiCorp Vault](https://https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault) learning track. 

You will find that once you have mastered the provisioning of infrastructure you will soon have to solve the challenge of managing secrets at scale and Vault does an excellent job of simplifying this workflow.

## Learning to fish
The most important skill you can develop as a technologist is the ability to find information that is related the technology that you are attempting. Fortunately there is a wealth of knowledge that is shared on the internet and I hope that these resources will set you off on the right path.

>Sometimes the best way to learn the inner-workings of Terraform is to simply set some time aside to pull apart a complicated module. I recommend taking a look at [HashiCorp modules](https://registry.terraform.io/search?q=hashicorp&verified=true) that have been written by the team at [Gruntworks](https://gruntwork.io/) and published to the [Terraform Module Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/).
